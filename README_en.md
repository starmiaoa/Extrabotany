## KubeJS

You can use KubeJS to add your custom recipes.

## Maven
For developers, here is a simple tutorial on developing with Extrabotany.

Since Extrabotany is a multi-platform project, you may only need to develop an addon for the Forge side. Therefore, the following tutorial is specifically designed for Forge.

Here is an example of depending on Extrabotany on the Forge side. Add the following to your `build.gradle`:

```groovy
repositories {
    maven {
        name = "lounode" //Extrabotany
        url = "https://maven.lounode.top/releases"
    }
}

dependencies {
    compileOnly fg.deobf("io.github.lounode.extrabotany:extrabotany-forge:[VERSION]")
    runtimeOnly fg.deobf("io.github.lounode.extrabotany:extrabotany-forge:[VERSION]")
}
```
You can find the version number to fill in [here](https://maven.lounode.top/#/releases/io/github/lounode/extrabotany/extrabotany-forge).
